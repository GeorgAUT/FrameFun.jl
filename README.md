FrameFuns
=========

Exploring practical possibilities of approximating functions with frames rather than with a basis. The package is heavily inspired by the Chebfun project and the Julia package ApproxFun.

This is a proof-of-concept implementation for demonstration purposes. At the moment, it is not functional.
